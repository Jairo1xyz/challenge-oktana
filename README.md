# Challenge

This is a challenge solved by me for an Oktana project.\

## Installation

Open a terminal or console and navigate to directory you want to clone the project and run:

### `git clone https://github.com/Jairo1xyz/challenge-oktana.git`

Then:

### `cd challenge-oktana`

### `npm install`

### `cd server`

And again:

### `npm install`

Then if you are in Mac or Linux run:

### `cd ..`

If you are in Windows run:

### `cd..`

Then comes the time to execute the project.

## Execution

To run the project execute:

### `npm start`

Wait for the system to build and run the project.\ Then in your browser open the URL:

[http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

And then it's time to use the app.\

## Use of the app

1) Choose a risk level (Buttons numerated from 1 to 10).\

2) Optional: alternate between the Donut chart and the table clicking the repective "See..." button.\

3) Click Continue.\

4) Fill the amounts you currently have on each investment category.\

5) Clic Rebalance.\

6) Optional: Clic on the house image to go back and repeat from step 1.\
